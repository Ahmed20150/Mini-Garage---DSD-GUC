# Mini Garage Project

Welcome to the Mini Garage project! This project simulates a special type of garage where a gate opens automatically upon detecting a car, and keeps track of the number of entering cars using a 7 segment display.

## Description

In this project, the gate opens automatically when it detects a car approaching. Once the car enters after the gate opens, the monitor increases the count of entering cars by 1.

## Tasks

1. **Initialization**: The number of cars is initially set to zero.
2. **Car Detection**: A sensor is utilized to detect when a car approaches the gate.
3. **Gate Control**: The gate opens automatically upon detecting a car.
4. **Gate Closure**: Upon detection of the car passing the gate, the gate returns to its initial position using an actuator.
5. **Display**: The number of cars is displayed on the 7 segment display.

## Components

- Sensor: Detects when a car approaches the gate.
- Actuator: Returns the gate to its initial position.
- 7 Segment Display: Displays the number of entering cars.

## Setup Instructions

1. Connect the sensor, actuator, and 7 segment display to the microcontroller or development board.
2. Upload the appropriate code to the microcontroller.
3. Ensure all connections are secure and functioning properly.
4. Test the system by approaching the gate with a car to trigger automatic gate opening and passing a car through the gate.

## Usage

1. The gate opens automatically when a car approaches.
2. When a car is detected passing through the gate, the gate closes automatically.
3. The 7 segment display will update to show the current count of entering cars.
